github-Python
=============

This handful of small scripts was created to compare two related repos, one  private internal repo of curriculum development work, and another widely-shared private repo which has the published course as the initial commmit. (PLTW continuously improves course materials in collaboration with network teachers. In CS, this collaboration uses GitHub for version control, and these scripts help identify commits from the development work that needed to be made in the corresponding repository shared to the teachers.)
